Notes on using Git and Github for version control.

Includes creating repositories on Github, cloning Github repositories on local machine, connecting local directories to Github repositories, and perform syncing (staging changes, commits, push and pull).

### Note for managing multiple accounts in VS Code:
1. Check **Credential Manager > Windows Credentials > Generic Credentials** and search for your github credentials.
2. Remove the credentials from the credential manager and sign out of your github account from VS Code.
3. Running git commands will now prompt you to log in to your desired account. Log in using your appropriate account.
